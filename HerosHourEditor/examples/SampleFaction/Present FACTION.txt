LORE NAME:
Counsil of Presents

LORE MAIN RACE:
Aetherkin

LORE HISTORY:
This fledgling group of aetherkin and elementals comes from far away, and rarely interacts with the lands of Astoria. However, once a year, they hold a ritual, after which they head to lands all around the world, bringing presents or punishment to whomever they decide deserve it.

LORE CULTURE:
A mish mash of unthinking elementals and more advanced aetherkin, all they have in common is their obsession with justice. Broadly, the Counsil is split in two groups: Those who believe bad acts should be punished, and those who believe that though people are mostly bad, it is more effective to reward good behaviour than to punish.

LORE HERO FIGHTER:
While the Nicebringers bring out gifts to virtuous people each Presentmas, they spend the rest of the year fighting and leading their armies

LORE HERO CASTER:
In opposition to Nicebringers, the Naughtymakers hold grudges and are highly judgemental of people who do bad things - however rare this may be
